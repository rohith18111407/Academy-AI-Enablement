    "response_text": "Here's a Python program to find whether a given number is odd or even:\n\n```python\n# Take input from the user\nnum = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n\n# Check if the number is odd or even\nif num % 2 == 0:\n    print(f\"{num} is an even number.\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"{num} is an odd number.\")\n```\n\nHere's how the program works:\n\n1. The program first prompts the user to enter a number using the `input()` function. The `int()` function is used to convert the input string to an integer.\n\n2. The program then uses the modulus operator `%` to check the remainder when the number is divided by 2. If the remainder is 0, it means the number is divisible by 2, and therefore, it is an even number. If the remainder is non-zero, it means the number is not divisible by 2, and therefore, it is an odd number.\n\n3. Finally, the program prints out a message indicating whether the number is odd or even using an f-string (formatted string literal).\n\nHere are some examples of how the program runs:\n\n```\nEnter a number: 10\n10 is an even number.\n```\n\n```\nEnter a number: 7\n7 is an odd number.\n```\n\n```\nEnter a number: 0\n0 is an even number.\n```\n\nNote that this program assumes the user enters a valid integer. If the user enters a non-integer value, the program will raise a `ValueError` exception.",

    "response_text": "To get the top 5 customers by revenue in the last 6 months, you can use the following SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT\n    c.customer_name,\n    SUM(o.order_total) AS total_revenue\nFROM\n    customers c\n    JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id\nWHERE\n    o.order_date >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 6 MONTH)\nGROUP BY\n    c.customer_id\nORDER BY\n    total_revenue DESC\nLIMIT 5;\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of the query:\n\n1. `SELECT c.customer_name, SUM(o.order_total) AS total_revenue`: This line selects the `customer_name` from the `customers` table and calculates the sum of `order_total` from the `orders` table, aliasing it as `total_revenue`.\n\n2. `FROM customers c`: This line specifies the main table to select data from, which is the `customers` table, aliased as `c`.\n\n3. `JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id`: This line performs an inner join between the `customers` and `orders` tables based on the `customer_id` column. It links each customer with their corresponding orders.\n\n4. `WHERE o.order_date >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 6 MONTH)`: This line filters the results to include only orders that were placed within the last 6 months. `DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 6 MONTH)` calculates the date 6 months before the current date.\n\n5. `GROUP BY c.customer_id`: This line groups the results by `customer_id` to calculate the total revenue for each customer.\n\n6. `ORDER BY total_revenue DESC`: This line sorts the results in descending order based on the `total_revenue` column, ensuring that the customers with the highest revenue are listed first.\n\n7. `LIMIT 5`: This line limits the output to the top 5 rows, giving us the top 5 customers by revenue in the last 6 months.\n\nThis query is optimized by:\n\n- Using appropriate indexes on the `customer_id` and `order_date` columns to improve query performance.\n- Avoiding unnecessary calculations or subqueries.\n- Utilizing the `LIMIT` clause to retrieve only the required number of rows.\n\nNote: Make sure to replace `customers` and `orders` with the actual table names in your database, and adjust the column names accordingly.",

    "prompt": "What is the difference between Horizontal and Vertical Scaling?",
    "response_text": "Horizontal Scaling and Vertical Scaling are two different approaches to scaling computing resources to handle increased workload or traffic.\n\n1. Vertical Scaling (Scale Up/Scale Down):\nVertical Scaling, also known as \"scaling up\" or \"scaling down,\" refers to the process of increasing or decreasing the resources (such as CPU, RAM, or storage) of a single server or instance. This is typically done by adding more powerful hardware components or allocating more resources to the existing machine.\n\nIn vertical scaling, you upgrade the capacity of a single node by adding more resources, such as:\n- Adding more CPU cores\n- Adding more RAM\n- Upgrading to faster storage (SSD or NVMe)\n- Upgrading to a more powerful instance type (in the cloud environment)\n\nThe advantage of vertical scaling is that it is relatively simple and requires no significant architectural changes. However, there is a limit to how much you can scale vertically, as you are constrained by the maximum capacity of a single machine.\n\n2. Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out/Scale In):\nHorizontal Scaling, also known as \"scaling out\" or \"scaling in,\" refers to the process of adding or removing multiple instances or servers to handle increased or decreased workload. This approach distributes the workload across multiple machines rather than increasing the resources of a single machine.\n\nIn horizontal scaling, you add or remove instances or servers, such as:\n- Adding more servers or virtual machines to a cluster or load-balanced environment\n- Adding more containers or pods in a containerized environment\n- Leveraging auto-scaling features to automatically add or remove instances based on demand\n\nThe advantage of horizontal scaling is that it allows for virtually unlimited scalability by adding more resources as needed. It also provides better fault tolerance and high availability, as the load is distributed across multiple instances, reducing the impact of a single point of failure.\n\nHowever, horizontal scaling can be more complex to implement and manage, as it often requires additional infrastructure components like load balancers, cluster management tools, and data replication mechanisms.\n\nIn summary, vertical scaling focuses on increasing the resources of a single machine, while horizontal scaling focuses on adding or removing multiple machines to handle the workload. The choice between vertical and horizontal scaling depends on factors such as the application's scalability requirements, cost considerations, and the underlying infrastructure's capabilities.",

    "response_text": "**Horizontal Scaling vs Vertical Scaling**\n\n1. **Definition:**\n   - **Horizontal Scaling:** Involves increasing capacity by adding more resources (e.g., servers, machines) to handle increased workloads. It's commonly used in cloud environments where multiple instances or nodes are added to manage surges in demand.\n   - **Vertical Scaling:** Enhances the capabilities of existing resources without adding new ones, typically through hardware upgrades (e.g., faster processors, more memory).\n\n2. **Use Cases:**\n   - **Horizontal Scaling:** Suitable for scenarios with expected growth or spikes in demand, such as handling increased server load by adding more machines.\n   - **Vertical Scaling:** Appropriate when optimizing existing infrastructure to improve efficiency and performance without increasing the number of resources.\n\n3. **Load Balancing and Fault Tolerance:**\n   - **Horizontal Scaling:** Facilitates load balancing and fault tolerance, allowing systems to adapt if one node fails by utilizing others.\n   - **Vertical Scaling:** Primarily focuses on individual resource enhancement rather than managing task distribution across multiple nodes.\n\n4. **Examples:**\n   - **Horizontal Scaling:** Adding more servers in a data center during peak traffic hours.\n   - **Vertical Scaling:** Upgrading each server's hardware, such as installing faster CPUs or adding RAM, to improve performance per machine.\n\nIn summary, horizontal scaling addresses demand growth by distributing tasks across multiple resources, while vertical scaling optimizes individual resources for better performance.
